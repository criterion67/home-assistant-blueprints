  name: Leak Alert Notification Loop with Siren & TTS
  description: >
    When a leak is detected, this automation announces the alert via TTS, sends a mobile notification with Snooze and Dismiss actions, and triggers a repeating siren loop. Repeats every 5 minutes until dismissed or the leak clears.
